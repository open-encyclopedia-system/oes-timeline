# OES Timeline Module
Welcome to the Open Encyclopedia System (OES) Timeline repository on GitHub.  
OES is a modular and configurable software platform for creating, publishing, and maintaining online encyclopedias in the humanities and social sciences. It is designed to be accessible worldwide through Open Access.

For more information, please visit the [main repository](https://github.com/open-encyclopedia-system) or our [website](https://open-encyclopedia-system.org).

A typical OES application consists of:

The **OES Timeline** plugin displays a collection of events as a timeline.
